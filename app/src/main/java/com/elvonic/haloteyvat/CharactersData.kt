        "While not yet a knight, she seeks to one day join the Knights of Favonius by first serving as a dutiful maid. Working as a maid at the Knights' headquarters, she is constantly taking notes on what constitutes knightly speech, knightly conduct, and knightly customs.",
        "As the Yuheng of the Liyue Qixing, she is someone who seeks her own answers instead of idly letting chaos run amok in Liyue. She chooses her own path with her own power and ability, instead of letting the gods determine her fate.",
        "The daughter of Frederica Gunnhildr and Seamus Pegg, the older sister of Barbara, and a descendant of the prestigious Gunnhildr Clan, Jean is the Acting Grand Master of the Knights of Favonius. She is always busy handling unrest across Mondstadt and of course, tirelessly working to maintain the City of Freedom.",
        "Fischl is an investigator for Mondstadt's Adventurers' Guild, accompanied by the night raven Oz. Fischl claims to hail from a world beyond Teyvat. She is a daring adventurer with seemly outlandish theories that happen to turn out to be true."
